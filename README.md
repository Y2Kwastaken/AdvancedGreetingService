**Q:** How do I add a language?

**A:** To add a language all you need to do is go into the folder you wish to run your jar file at.
If you have already run AdvancedGreetingService you should see a `languages` folder, this is
the default languages, however, it can change it in the `config.json`. Now if we want to create en/uwu
for example open `languages` and create the folder `en` if it does not exist. Then create the `uwu` folder.
You can then configure the corresponding `lang.json` in this case
```json
{
  "id": "en-uwu",
  "standard.greeting": "Hewwo, Wowwd?!?!"
}
```

**Q**: How many man hours did it take to make this?

**A**: Me and my team spent thousands of hours developing the perfect AdvancedGreetingService.
Please enjoy the service if you have an issue please report it in the issues!
